      <h2>Achievement</h2>
      <p>Throughout my time in CSCI 202: Dynamic Web Pages, I engaged in hands-on web development, building interactive and dynamic projects that showcase both technical proficiency and creativity. From Mood Transformation to Neon 42 - Chatbot Traveler, I explored user-centered design, crafting intuitive and engaging digital experiences. My work on Painting Collection, Painting Animation, and Famous Paintings deepened my understanding of structured data and animation, allowing me to create visually compelling showcases. Additionally, projects like Study Spot Finder and Suggestions4Free reinforced my ability to develop practical solutions that address real-world needs. Through these efforts, I strengthened my foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON, gaining confidence in structuring, styling, and implementing meaningful digital experiences.</p>

      <h2>Acknowledgment</h2>
      <p>I am grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow throughout CSCI 202: Dynamic Web Pages. This journey would not have been possible without the invaluable guidance of my instructors, the collaborative support of my peers, and my own dedication to refining my skills. Every challenge and breakthrough helped shape my understanding of web development, preparing me for future projects in software engineering and digital innovation. I look forward to building upon this foundation and continuing to push the boundaries of technology and design.</p>

      <h2>How I've Expanded My Project?</h2>
      <p>To expand my project, I went beyond the initial requirements by integrating multiple skill I developed during the course. I added dynamic features using JavaScript and JSON to enhance interactivity and data handling. I improved the visual design with refined CSS styling for better user experience and responsive layouts. I also linked my projects to GitHub for version control and accessibility, included real-world inspirations like interesting websites, and documented my process through videos and written reflections. These additions demonstrate my growth in both technical ability and creative problem-solving, making the project more polished, engaging, and impactful.
